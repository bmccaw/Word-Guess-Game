Word Guess Game

Currently Working
=====================
- Computer picks a random word from the array
- If user key is part of the word, it populates on the screen
- If user key is not in the word, it is added to the 'Letters already guessed' array and 'Guesses remaining' decreases by 1
- If there are not more empty spaces, win counter increases by 1
- If 'Guesses remaining' reaches zero, loss counter increases by 1
- Game resets after win or loss

Current Bugs
=====================
- currently only on 'space' is populating the HTML instead of spaces equal to the number of letters in the chosen word
